# Federation Credentials Verification Service API

This is the source for technical information for the Federation of State Medical Boards' Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS) [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). 
The FCVS API can be used by state medical boards (SMBs) to retrieve information about FCVS applications submitted to the board. 

If you are interested in learning more about this API, using it in your application or accessing the [Postman]( https://www.getpostman.com/) collection,  please contact [FSMB](mailto:fcvs@fsmb.org).

## Authentication 

The FCVS API uses [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) credentialing authentication. A client id and client secret are necessary for authentication. Contact FSMB for access to a client id and client secret. 

Using the client id and client secret execute the authentication request. You will receive a bearer token containing the access token. All subsequent requests will require the token for authentication. The token will expire periodically and it will be necessary to get another token.
